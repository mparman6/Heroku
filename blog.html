	                As a student at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I am learning all the skills and tools it takes to become a full-stack web developer. I have been trying to teach myself all of these things the past few years using various resources such as official documentation, tutorials, youtube videos, and online classes. I've come to realize as much as I learned on my own, if I want to get to where I want to be, I had to find a way to pick up the pace. I started exploring the idea of dev bootcamps but they closest ones I found we're all in New York City and it required you to quit your job since the classes were five days a week during the day. I finally stumbled across Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, decided to apply, and was ecstatic when I found out I was accepted. I can't believe how welcoming and friendly the staff is and how collaborative my classmates are. I am looking forward to the rest of this journey as we continue to learn more and more!
