		                	<li>I am looking to become a Computer Science or STEM Supervisor where I can take my skills and experience to bring full-stack web development curriculum to a school district. In this day and age students need to have access to learn the skills necessary to become web developers yet there is such a minimal amount of teachers and adminstrators with the knowledge to effectively teach students these skills. With my Computer Engineering background and 13 years of teaching experience I can write curriculum, train teachers, and teach students all the skills necessary to become full-stack web developers by the time they graduate high school and put them in higly competitive positions when applying to top colleges and universities.</li>
		                	<li>I am also looking to do free-lance work on web development projects.</li>

		                I love teaching and I love technology. I am happy that my job allows me to feed both passions.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>I also teach Web Design (HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap) and 21st Century Computer Applications which focuses on students mastering cloud-based computing through the Google Apps suite.</li>
							<li>I am a Tech Educator at South Brunswick High School in New Jersey. I am responsible for training teachers and staff on implementing the Google Apps suite into their workflow and curriculum. By using Google Apps district staff become more organized and efficient. Teachers are able to develop creative and innovative lessons.</li>
